This project is a simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates how to create a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using MySQL as the database and Basic Authentication for securing the API endpoints. It is a great starting point for developers who want to build RESTful web services with Spring Boot while leveraging the power of a MySQL database and adding a layer of basic security.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: The application supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for a `User` entity. Users can be added, retrieved, updated, and deleted through a set of API endpoints.

- **MySQL Database**: The project is configured to work with a MySQL database. The database schema is automatically updated based on the entity classes.

- **Basic Authentication**: API endpoints are secured with Basic Authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the data.

- **Lombok Integration**: The project also demonstrates the use of Lombok to reduce boilerplate code. Lombok annotations are used to generate getter, setter, and other commonly used methods.
